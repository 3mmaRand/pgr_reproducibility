# Introduction
Aquatic and marine mammals are able to dive underwater for extended periods as a result of having a higher muscle myoglobin concentration than terrestrial mammals [@Kanatous2741] found that 83% of the variation in Toothed whale species (odontocetes) dive capacity was accounted for by body mass and myoglobin content.
Seal species are also known to vary in dive length. We investigated whether the concentration of myoglobin differed between three species of seal: Weddell Seal, Harbour Seals and Bladdernose Seals. See Figure \@ref(fig:weddell-fig)

# Methods
```{r import}
# Data import
# the data are organised in to three columns, one for each species. 
seal <- read_table("raw_data/seal.txt")
```

```{r tidy}
# put the data in tidy format
seal2 <- seal %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "species",
               values_to = "myoglobin",
               cols = everything())
```

```{r summarise}
sealsummary <- seal2 %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(myoglobin),
            std = sd(myoglobin),
            n = length(myoglobin),
            se = std/sqrt(n))
```

We measured the myoglobin content of the skeletal muscle of `r sealsummary$n[1]` individuals in each of three species.
We used R [@R-core] with tidyverse packages [@tidyverse] for all analyses and the rmarkdown [@markdown1] and bookdown [@bookdown] packages for manuscript preparation.

# Results

```{r extract}
# extract values for inline reporting

highestmean <- max(sealsummary$mean)
highestse <- sealsummary$se[sealsummary$mean == highestmean]
highestspp <- sealsummary$species[sealsummary$mean == highestmean]
lowestmean <- min(sealsummary$mean)
lowestse <- sealsummary$se[sealsummary$mean == lowestmean]
lowestspp <- sealsummary$species[sealsummary$mean == lowestmean]

```

```{r testing}
mod <- aov(data = seal2, myoglobin ~ species)

# extract values for inline reporting
res <- summary(mod)[[1]]
fval <- round(res$`F value`[1], 2)
df1 <- res$Df[1]
df2 <- res$Df[2]
p <- round(res$`Pr(>F)`[1], 3)
```

```{r posthoc, include=FALSE}
TukeyHSD(mod)
```
There is a significant difference in myoglobin concentration between species (_F_ = `r fval`; _d.f._ =`r df1`, `r df2`; _p_ = `r p`). Post-hoc testing revealed that difference to be between the `r highestspp` seal with the highest myoglobin concentrations ($\bar{x} \pm s.e.$: `r round(highestmean,2)` $\pm$ `r round(highestse,2)` g Kg^-1^) and the `r lowestspp` seal with the lowest (`r round(lowestmean,2)` $\pm$ `r round(lowestse,2)` g Kg^-1^). See Figure \@ref(fig:myo-fig).
I've also gratuitously included a table with the same information just for the sake of including a table. See Table \@ref(tab:summary-table).  

```{r summary-table}
knitr::kable(sealsummary,
             digits = 2,
             caption = 'A summary of the data.',
             row.names = FALSE)
```
