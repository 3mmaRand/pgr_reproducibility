# Introduction to Reproducibility in R

One-day workshop (or equivalent) for first year bioscience PhD students at the White Rose Universities (York, Sheffield, Leeds).

## Overview

Underlying all biological discoveries are data! The ability to generate reliable measures of biological phenomena through experimental design, modelling or simulation, and then analyse and communicate the results are essential skills for a biologist. This is has always been true but an explosion of large-scale, complex and noisy data has made the acquisition of data skills even more crucial. Such skills include being able to statistically analyse and visualise data generated by research from the ecological to the biomolecular. To critically evaluate inferences arising from these analyses and  advancing the methodology is dependent on research findings being published with their data and analysis code. This is a characteristic known as “reproducibility” and it requires at least some coding. Coding makes everything you do with your raw data explicitly described, totally transparent and completely reproducible. 

R is a free and open source language especially well-suited to data analysis and visualisation and has a relatively inclusive and newbie-friendly community. R caters to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allows them to slide gradually into programming.

## Prerequisites
I recognise that students will enter this training with diverse previous experience with R. The aim to ensure all students get something out of the training no matter where they start.
There will be some parallel sessions for those with and without previous experience. Pre-course instructions for participants are given below.

# Philosophy and approach

Impossible to cover everything to you might ever need! Different people will use different methods and tools. Chosen topics are: foundational, widely applicable and transferable conceptually.


## Learning outcomes

After this workshop the successful learner will be able to:

* Find their way around the RStudio windows
* Create and plot data using the base package and ggplot
* Explain the rationale for scripting analysis
* Use the help pages
* Know how to make additional packages available in an R session
* Reproducibly import data in a variety of formats
* Understand what is meant by the working directory, absolute and relative paths and be able to apply these concepts to data import
* Summarise data in a single group or in multiple groups
* Recognise tidy data format and carry out some typical data tidying tasks
* Develop highly organised analyses including well-commented scripts that can be understood by future you and others
* Use R Markdown to produce reproducible analyses, figures and reports

## Pre-course instructions for participants

### Precourse survey

Was sent in March

### Computing requirements

For the one-day workshop
There are computers at the venue and you will be given an IT account if you do not have a york.ac.uk account already.
