# Introduction to Reproducibility in R

Training programme for first year bioscience PhD students at the White Rose Universities (York, Sheffield, Leeds).

## Overview

Underlying all biological discoveries are data! The ability to generate reliable measures of biological phenomena through experimental design, modelling or simulation, and then analyse and communicate the results are essential skills for a biologist. This is has always been true but an explosion of large-scale, complex and noisy data has made the acquisition of data skills even more crucial. Such skills include being able to statistically analyse and visualise data generated by research from the ecological to the biomolecular. To critically evaluate inferences arising from these analyses and  advancing the methodology is dependent on research findings being published with their data and analysis code. This is a characteristic known as “reproducibility” and it requires at least some coding. Coding makes everything you do with your raw data explicitly described, totally transparent and completely reproducible. 

R is a free and open source language especially well-suited to data analysis and visualisation and has a relatively inclusive and newbie-friendly community. R caters to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allows them to slide gradually into programming.


This programme comprises several modules lasting from 30 minutes to 2 hours. The selection of modules you undertake will depend on your previous experience.

## Prerequisites

I recognise that people will enter this training with a diverse range of previous experience in R. This is a challenge to manage but the aim is for everyone to get something out of the training no matter where they start. 
There will be sessions for those with and without previous experience. Pre-course instructions for participants are given below.

# Philosophy and approach

It is impossible to cover everything to you might ever need! Different people will use different methods and tools. Topics have been chosen topics because they are: foundational, widely applicable and transferable conceptually.


## Learning outcomes

After this workshop the successful learner will be able to:

* Find their way around the RStudio windows
* Create and plot data using the base package and ggplot
* Explain the rationale for scripting analysis
* Use the help pages
* Know how to make additional packages available in an R session
* Reproducibly import data in a variety of formats
* Understand what is meant by the working directory, absolute and relative paths and be able to apply these concepts to data import
* Summarise data in a single group or in multiple groups
* Recognise tidy data format and carry out some typical data tidying tasks
* Develop highly organised analyses including well-commented scripts that can be understood by future you and others
* Use R Markdown to produce reproducible analyses, figures and reports

## Pre-course instructions for participants

### Precourse survey

To help me direct you to useful training and manage diversity in previous experience during the sessions, please complete this form to indicate your current level: https://forms.gle/cpSjdcjVa7niz6iq5

### Computing requirements

Laptops should have the following installed **prior** to attending the workshop:

- R version 3.6 or higher
- RStudio (1.2)
- these packages: tidyverse, janitor, rticles

### Installing R

Download the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/ and install. More specifically:

**For Windows**

Click "Download R for Windows", then "base", then "Download R 4.0.0 for Windows". This will download an `.exe` file; once downloaded, open to start the installation. You can accept all the defaults.

**For Mac**

Click "Download R for (Mac) OS X", then "R-4.0.0.pkg" to download the installer.
Run the installer to complete installation. You can accept all the defaults.

**For Linux**

Click "Download R for Linux". Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both `r-base` and `r-base-dev`.

### Installing R Studio

Download and install the version for your OS from: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
You can accept all the defaults.

**For Windows with no admin rights**

Download the `.zip` source archive under "Zip/Tarballs". Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. `C:\Users\username\RStudio`. In this folder, open the `bin` directory and find the RStudio program: it is named `rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for `rstudio`. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.


### Installing packages

Once you have installed R and RStudio, start RStudio up and go to the Packages tab in the bottom right pane; click Install and type the name of the package you want to install in the box that appears. Then wait until you get the cursor (>) back in the console window.

## Issues 

Typically R, Rstudio and R packages are painless to install. However, if you encounter problems there will be Zoom office hours on May 18, 1400-1530 assist with set up.
