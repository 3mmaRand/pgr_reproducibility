# Analytics R 1: Introduction to reproducible analyses in R
## Course content

An increase in the complexity and scale of biological data means biologists are increasingly required to develop the data skills needed to design reproducible workflows for the simulation, collection, organisation, processing, analysis and presentation of data. Developing such data skills requires at least some coding, also known as scripting. This makes your work (everything you do with your raw data) explicitly described, totally transparent and completely reproducible. However, learning to code can be a daunting prospect for many biologists! That’s where an [Introduction to reproducible analyses in R](https://github.com/3mmaRand/pgr_reproducibility) comes in!

R is a free and open source language especially well-suited to data analysis and visualisation and has a relatively inclusive and newbie-friendly community. R caters to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allows them to slide gradually into programming.

# Prerequisites

I recognise that people will enter this training with a diverse range of previous experience in R. This is a challenge to manage but the aim is for everyone to get something out of the training no matter where they start. There will be tutor-led sessions for those without previous experience and materials for those with experience to workthough with the help of floating tutors. Pre-course instructions for participants are given below.

# Learning outcomes

After these modules the successful learner will be able to:

-   Find their way around the RStudio windows
-   Create and plot data using the base package and ggplot
-   Explain the rationale for scripting analysis
-   Use the help pages
-   Know how to make additional packages available in an R session
-  Understand what is meant by the working directory, absolute and relative paths and be able to apply these concepts to data import
-   Summarise data in a single group or in multiple groups
-   Recognise tidy data format and carry out some typical data tidying tasks
-   Develop highly organised analyses including well-commented scripts that can be understood by future you and others
-   Use R Markdown to produce reproducible analyses, figures and reports
