# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

```{r echo = FALSE}
file <- "raw_data/intro_to_reproducubility_ precourse.csv"
survey <- read_csv(file) 
```


## How do you work?

* What program do you analyse your data in?  
* What program do you plot your data in?  
--
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=9}
survey %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `In what package/programme are you MOST likely to carry out data analysis and visualisation currently?`)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#9d5e78") +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of people",
                     expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f6fafd"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f6fafd"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
  coord_flip()
  
```

# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown 

* What is your process for getting your summary data, statistical results, tables and figures in to your report?  
--

* What do you do when you get additional data that increases your sample sizes?  
--

* What do you do if you wrote in Word formatted for one journal and now have to submit in PDF formatted for another?

---
# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## How do you work?

Typically people analyse, plot and write up in different programs. 

Graphs are saved to files and copied and pasted into the final report. 

This process relies on manual labour. 

If the data changes, the author must repeat the entire process to update the report.

# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

The brilliance of R Markdown `r Cite(myBib, "markdown1", "markdown2")` is that you can use a **single R Markdown file** to:

* save and execute code  

--

* do all your data processing, analysis and plotting  

--

* generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience  

--


This is a time-efficient and reproducible way to write!

# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Let's get started

### Organising your work

You are going to work with some made-up data on the myoglobin content in the skeletal muscle of three species of seal

--

Create a new project called 'seals'

--

Inside 'seals', make folders called 'raw_data' and 'processed_data'

--


I strongly recommend avoiding spaces in names of files, folders and variable names.

R can cope with them....  but they can often confuse humans!

--

Save a copy of [seal.txt](seals/raw_data/seal.txt) to the 'raw_data' folder


---
# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Live demo

Just watch for a while....

---
# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Key points from the demo


* mixes text and code  
* human readable  
* YAML header between the  \-\-\-
* code chunk options control whether the code and its output end up in your 'knitted' document  
* comments   
  * in a code chunk the \# is still used for comments  
  * in the text a comment is written like this  <!\-\- a comment \-\->
  * but use Ctrl+Shift+C  
* \# in the text indicate headings  


---
# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Your own R markdown file

File | New File | R Markdown

--

Delete everything except the YAML header the first code chunk

--

Add your name, and a title 

You could copy and paste a title from [paper.html](../seals/paper.html)

---
# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Your own R markdown file

### Default code chunk behaviour.

Set some **default** code chunk options. I recommend these:


````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```
````

`echo = FALSE` means the code will not be included by default - this is normally what you want in a report.

Any output *is* included by default.

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Your own R markdown file

### References

References and citations can be added by creating a .bib file containing references in BibTeX format and another line to the YAML header.


--

`bibliography: mybibfile.bib` must be added to the YAML header.<sup>1</sup>
.footnote[
1. There are other ways of including references such as using `RefManageR` package which is what I am using in these slides.

]


---
# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Your own R markdown file

### References

Citations are added using:
  *  blah blah blah `[@xaringan]` for blah blah blah `r Cite(myBib, "xaringan")`.    
  *  Xie `[-@xaringan]` said blah blah blah for `r Cite(myBib, "xaringan",textual = TRUE)` said blah blah blah.  

--

If you have installed the `citr` package there is an Addin to help with this.

--

Every citation used results in the reference being added to a list at the bottom of the output.

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Your own R markdown file

### References

#### Make a .bib file

Do File | New file | Text file

Save as `mybibfile.bib`

#### Add BibTeX entries

`citation("package")` in the console will give packages references in BibTeX format.  

BibTeX format is also available through most referencing software (e.g., PaperPile).

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a section of text

### Introduction

Add a header for the introductions and text - again you could copy and paste.

```
# Introduction
Aquatic and marine mammals are able to dive
underwater.................................
...investigated whether the concentration of
myoglobin differed between  species.

```
--


Save your file.

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a code chunk

### Packages

The first two code chunks are usually for the default code chunk options (which I tend to call `setup`) and for package loading.Use Insert | R to add a code chunk

Load the tidyverse

.pull-left[
````
```{r packages}`r ''`
library(tidyverse)

```
````
]
.pull-right[
* `r`indicates it is an R code chunk
* `packages` is just a name for the chunk. Naming chunks makes debugging easier.

]

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a section of text

### Methods

Add a heading for the Methods section including a reference to R.

```
# Methods
We used R [@R-core] with tidyverse packages [@tidyverse] for all analyses.

```
--
Hit Knit!

This should render as:

We used R (R Core Team 2019) with tidyverse packages (Wickham 2017) for all analyses.




---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a code chunk

### Importing data

Insert a code chunk for importing the data


````
```{r import}`r ''`
# Data import
# the data are organised in to three columns, one for each species. 
seal <- read.table("raw_data/seal.txt", header = TRUE)
```
````

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Run a code chunk

### Interactively..

Note you can run the code interactively to check your progress and the output will be shown in the Rmd document.


````
```{r import}`r ''`
# Data import
# the data are organised in to three columns, one for each species. 
seal <- read.table("raw_data/seal.txt", header = TRUE)
str(seal)
```
````

````
'data.frame':	30 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ Harbour    : num  49.7 51 41.6 45.6 39.4 ...
 $ Weddell    : num  55.4 40.1 46.3 29.8 52.5 ...
 $ Bladdernose: num  56.2 48.4 37.8 42.8 27 ...
```` 



---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a code chunk

### Tidying data

Insert a code chunk for tidying the data and writing it out to a file

````
```{r tidy}`r ''`
# put the data in tidy format
seal2 <- gather(data = seal, key = species, value = myoglobin)

# write tidy data to processed
write.table(seal2, 
            "processed_data/seal2.txt",
            row.names = FALSE)
```
````

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a code chunk

### Summarising data

Insert a code chunk for summarising the data

# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Add a code chunk

### Summarising data

````
```{r summarise}`r ''`
sealsummary <- seal %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(myoglobin),
            std = sd(myoglobin),
            n = length(myoglobin),
            se = std/sqrt(n))
```
````

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## What is in `sealsummary`?

### Select a section of code

And run (ctrl-enter)


--

Knit your file


---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Inline code

### Example

Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file using inline code.

Inline code goes between ` `r` and ` ` ` . 

For example by writing: 

The squareroot of 2 is ` `r`  `sqrt(2)` ` ` ` 

you will get 

The squareroot of 2 is  `r sqrt(2)`

---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Inline code

### Discuss the highest mean

We could add

The highest mean is ` `r`  `max(sealsummary$mean)` ` ` `

to our text. 

When we knit the document we would get

The highest mean is 49.01033


---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Insert a code chunk

### To access object contents more easily

Insert a code chunk extracting values to make inline reporting easier

Don't worry too much about completely understanding the code

````
```{r extract}`r ''`
# extract values for inline reporting

highestmean <- max(sealsummary$mean)
highestse <- sealsummary$se[sealsummary$mean == highestmean]
highestspp <- sealsummary$species[sealsummary$mean == highestmean]
lowestmean <- min(sealsummary$mean)
lowestse <- sealsummary$se[sealsummary$mean == lowestmean]
lowestspp <- sealsummary$species[sealsummary$mean == lowestmean]

```
````
---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Your turn.

### Add a results section



---




# Reproducible Reports: R Markdown

## Adding text

### Special characters

You can include special characters in a markdown document using LaTeX markup. This has \$ signs on the outside and uses backslashes and curly braces to indicate that what follows should be interpreted as a special character of special formatting.

For example, to get $\bar{x} \pm s.e.$ you write `$\bar{x} \pm s.e.$`
