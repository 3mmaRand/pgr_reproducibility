  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",

  abstract = "Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most
              researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills
              for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses
              can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited
              in how effectively they can work with software and data.
              Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab
              projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps,
              and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers
              new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTData analysis, statistical research, and teaching
               statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities
               all produce many files! There are data files, source code,
               figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these
               files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be
               shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds.
               Without explicit and structured management, project organization
               can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary
               work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy
               result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from
               the software development world, namely, distributed version
               control. This article describes the use of the version control
               system Git and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data

               Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an
               inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just
               methods but errors. In this report we examine several related
               papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug
               sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response.
               Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to
               treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show
               in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple
               errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that
               emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or
               column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most
               simple errors are common. We then discuss steps we are taking to
               avoid such errors in our own investigations.]",

    abstract = {Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes.  Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Adélie and gentoo penguins. Adélies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate δ15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in δ15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Adélies, did yearly variation in δ15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality.  Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Adélies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in δ15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},
