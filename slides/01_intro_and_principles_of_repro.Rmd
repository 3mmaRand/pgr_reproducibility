**It is**
* An introduction to R for those without previous experience
* About using RStudio projects and good practice for code and project documentation and organisation
* An introduction to the tidyverse, RMarkdown, some more advanced data import

[3. RStudio Projects](03_rstudio_projects.html)  
Audience: Those without experience of RStudio projects
* Organising your work in a logical, consistent and reproducible way using RStudio Projects  
* Organisation of data  
* Organisation of analyses  
* Writing code with relative paths given appropriate to your project organisation

# Data analysis

# Data analysis

Mainly isn't statistics. ~80% of your time on getting data, cleaning data, aggregating data, reshaping data, and exploring data using exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

# Reproducibility is key!

```{r turing-reprod-matrix, echo = FALSE, out.width="700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/reproducible-matrix.jpg")
```

# Who cares?

* Many high profile cases of work which did not reproduce e.g. Anil Potti unravelled by `r Citet(myBib, "Baggerly2009-pw")` 

* Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly `r Cite(myBib, "Markowetz2015")`. Alternatively, see the [talk](https://youtu.be/yVT07Sukv9Q)


* **Will** become standard in Science and publishing e.g OECD Global Science Forum Building digital workforce capacity and skills for data-intensive science `r Cite(myBib, "OECD_Global_Science_Forum2020-cp")`

# Rationale for scripting analysis

# Rationale for scripting analysis
Science is the generation of ideas, designing work to test them and reporting the results.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rationale1.png")
```

# Rationale for scripting analysis
We ensure reproducibility of laboratory and field work by planning and recording in lab books and using standard protocols. 


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rationale2.png")
```

Even so replicating results can be hard.

Workflows for computational projects and the data analysis and reporting of other work can, and should, be 100% reproducible! Scripting is the way to achieve this.

# Why R?


---
# Why R?

Open source and free

--
 .......But so is Python
  
--

R has reputation for catering to users who do not see themselves as programmers, and  allowing them to slide gradually into programming.

![biologists](pics/biologist1.png)

--

Designed for data analysis and graphics - which means it is often easier to achieve those tasks in R than a general purpose programming language.

---
# Why R?

The R community is one of R's greatest assets, being vibrant, inclusive and supportive of users at all levels.

# Aspects of Reproducibility

---
# Aspects of Reproducibility 

* Data within files should be 'tidy'
* Project based approach
* Consistency: naming, space, style   
* Documentation: commenting and README  
* Literate programming e.g. Rmarkdown

# Summary

* The course is:
  * an introduction to reproducible analyses rather than statistics  
  * not enough, you need to practice!  
  * comprised of modules so you can opt out where you already have the skills  
* Scripting makes your work reproducible  
* Focus is on R but principles of reproducibility are widely applicable; use Python if you prefer
