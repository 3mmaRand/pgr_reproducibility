# Data analysis

How much of data analysis is using statistics?

Less than you probably think

~80% of your time on getting data, cleaning data, aggregating data, reshaping data, and exploring data using exploratory data analysis and data visualization.


---
# Reproducibility is key!

One definition
*"... obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis. This definition is synonymous with “computational reproducibility"*. `r Cite(myBib, "National_Academies_of_Sciences_Engineering2019-sb")`

Also see National Science Foundation `r Cite(myBib, "K_Bollen2015-un")`


---
# Who cares?

* Many high profile cases of work which did not reproduce e.g. Anil Potti unravelled by `r Citet(myBib, "Baggerly2009-pw")` 

* Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly `r Cite(myBib, "Markowetz2015")`. Alternatively, see the [talk](https://youtu.be/yVT07Sukv9Q)


* Will become standard in Science and publishing e.g OECD Global Science Forum Building digital workforce capacity and skills for data-intensive science `r Cite(myBib, "OECD_Global_Science_Forum2020-cp")`

Workflows for computational projects and the data analysis and reporting of other work can, and should, be 100% reproducible! Scripting is the way to achieve this.

# Rationale for scripting analysis

That reproducibility applies to all aspects of the data workflow.

From importing or collecting the data, processing it for analysis, building statistical models and communicating the methods and results.

These are usually iterative and that process of iteration (the development of the analysis) should also be captured.

# Why R?

# Why R?

Open source and free

 .......But so is Python
  
--

R has reputation for catering to users who do not see themselves as programmers, and  allowing them to slide gradually into programming.

![biologists](../pics/biologist1.png)

--

Designed for data analysis and graphics - which means it is often easier to achieve those tasks in R than a general purpose programming language.

# Aspects of Reproducibility

# Organisation of data 

Within files should be 'tidy'

Tidy data adhere to a consistent structure which makes it easier to manipulate, model and visualize them. 

1. Each variable has its own column.  
2. Each observation has its own row.  
3. Each value has its own cell.  

Closely allied to the relational algebra of relational databases `r Cite(myBib, "Codd1990-th")`.  
Underlies the enforced rectangular formatting in SPSS, STATA and R's dataframe.  
The term 'tidy data' was popularised by `r Citet(myBib, "Wickham2014-nl")`.   
There may be more than one potential tidy structure.  

---
# Tidy format

```{r echo=FALSE}
pigeon <- read.table("../data/pigeon.txt", header = T)
```

Suppose we had just 3 individuals in each of two populations:

.pull-left[

**Not tidy**

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(pigeon[1:3,], 
             format = "html")
```
]
```{r echo=FALSE}
pigeon2 <- gather(data = pigeon, 
                  key = population, 
                  value = distance)
```

.pull-right[

**Tidy!**
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(pigeon2[c(1:3,41:43),]), 
             format = "html",
             row.names = FALSE)

# Summary

* The course is:
  * an introduction to reproducible analyses rather than statistics  
  * not enough, you need to practice!  
  * comprised of modules so you can opt out where you already have the skills  
* Scripting makes your work reproducible  
* Focus is on R but principles are widely applicable; use Python if you prefer  
* Recognising structure in your data and organising in 'tidy' format will pay dividends  
* The structured, systematic and consistent organisation of analyses will pay dividends
