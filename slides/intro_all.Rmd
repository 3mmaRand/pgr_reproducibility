# Why R?

## Open source and free

--

### .......But so is Python
  
--

R caters to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allows them to slide gradually into programming  

![biologists](../pics/biologist1.png)

--

R was designed for data analysis and graphics  

But use Python if you already have those skills!

# Organisation of data within files

## What is tidy data?

One response per row.

Tidy data adhere to a consistent structure which makes it easier to manipulate, model and visualize them. The structure is defined by:  

1. Each variable has its own column.  
2. Each observation has its own row.  
3. Each value has its own cell.  

Closely allied to the relational algebra of relational databases `r Cite(myBib, "Codd1990-th")`.  
Underlies the enforced rectangular formating in SPSS, STATA and R's dataframe.  
The term 'tidy data' was popularised by `r Citet(myBib, "Wickham2014-nl")`.   
There may be more than one potential tidy structure.

# Organisation of data within files

```{r echo=FALSE}
pigeon <- read.table("../data/pigeon.txt", header = T)
```

## Tidy format

Suppose we had just 3 individuals in each of two populations:

.pull-left[
## NOT TIDY!
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(pigeon[1:3,], 
             format = "html")
```
]
```{r echo=FALSE}
pigeon2 <- gather(data = pigeon, 
                  key = population, 
                  value = distance)
```

.pull-right[

## TIDY!
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(pigeon2[c(1:3,41:43),]), 
             format = "html",
             row.names = FALSE)
```

# Organisation of analyses

* Project based approach, e.g., RStudio project or similar  
* directory structure 
* naming   
* commenting  
* readme  
* version control

# Organisation of analyses

.pull-left[

### Directories

* structured  
* systematic  
* repeatible  

### Naming

* human and machine readable  
  * no spaces  
  * use snake/kebab case  
  * ordering: numbers (zero left padded), dates  
  * file extensions
